# Orabota.ru – employee evaluation platform
Orabota was an early 2013 startup attempt by Maxim Neaga, targeted primarily for the Russian-speaking countries with the idea to help businesses relying on non-professional employees hire only the best candidates and avoid the troublesome ones. It allowed employers, partners and co-workers leave reviews about their peers. A live demo is still available at http://orabota.ru/ , although the project is minimally maintained for demonstration purposes only.
